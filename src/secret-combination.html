      <h2>The problem</h2>
      <p>Given that we have two buttons, A and B, we want to print a message if a “secret combination” (ABBABA) is clicked within 5 seconds. To make things a bit harder the following must also be true:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The message should be printed immediately when the secret combination is clicked. We should not wait until the end of the 5 second interval before the message is printed.</li>
        <li>As soon as the secret combination is fulfilled (within 5 seconds) the message should be displayed regardless of what has been clicked before. For example a combination like “BBABBABA” is ok as long as “ABBABA” is clicked within 5 seconds.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="bundle.js"></script>
  </body>
